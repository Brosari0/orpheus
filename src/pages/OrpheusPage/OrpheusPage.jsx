        It was believed by most ancient Greek philosophers/writes that Orpheus was in fact  real person.
        Aristotle was the only one who believed him to be a myth. Many Greek musicians 
        believed that Orpheus was "The Father of Songs". Although Hermes had invented 
        the lyre, Orpheus perfected it. Orpheus' music and singing could charm birds,
        beasts, coax the trees and rocks into dance, and divert the course of rivers.

        The Argonautica (Ἀργοναυτικά) is a Greek epic poem written by Apollonius Rhodius in the 3rd century BC.
        Orpheus took part in this adventure and used his skills to aid his companions. Chiron told Jason that without
        the aid of Orpheus, the Argonauts would never be able to pass the Sirens—the same Sirens encountered by Odysseus
        in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. The Sirens lived on three small, rocky islands called Sirenum scopuli and
        sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors to come to them, which resulted in the crashing of their ships into the
        islands. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his lyre and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning
        out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC Hellenistic elegiac poet Phanocles, Orpheus loved
        the young Argonaut Calais, "the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing
        of his desire, nor was his heart at rest. But always, sleepless cares wasted his spirits as he looked at fresh Calais."

        Orpheus was one of few greeks who went to the underworld and returned
        His music having power even over Hades. Although his music was strong,
        he didn't accomplish what he seeked in the underworld. His muse, reason
        for living, Eurydice (sometimes spellled Euridice) still remained trapped. If he had only been a little
        stronger he might have been able to save her.
