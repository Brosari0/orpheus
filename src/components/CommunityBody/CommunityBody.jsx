      <p className="statement">Bringing people together to enjoy music is our goal. Reaching out to help others, 
        jamming along with friends, seriously chasing a dream of creating something beautiful
        and be remembered. We may get here for different reasons, but in the end we're all just
        trying to enjoy what we love. Music.
